FUlly working messaging bot

connects to the Facebook API 

When a conversation starts we build a messaging loop that waits for the user response and take the next appropriate action .

The user can start different "programs" in the bot by asking for the different programs F.eks "order pizza" or choose from a menu 
when an order is placed the program opens a web view inside of messenger to process a credit card

when the user clicks pay 

The control is handed back to the bot that sends new messages.
